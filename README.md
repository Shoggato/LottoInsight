# Project Description
first to determine if there are any common powerball, powerplay, white numbers from the winning numbers.
second to see if max jackpot winnings have increased over time.

All data is pulled from the Washington state Powerball from June 2014 to November 2022.

The first question we attempted to answer by performing analysis on the mode values for the powerball, powerplay, and white numbers from the winning numbers.

The second question we performed analysis on the the max jackpots for each month, and then for each year.  Linear regression analysis is performed to see if there is any correlation between the max jackpots and the passage of time.
